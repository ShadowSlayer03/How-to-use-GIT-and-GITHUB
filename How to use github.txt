1. cd <path of folder from where you want to add files>

2. git init       // to initialise an empty git repo, skip if already done b4

3. git config --global user.name
4. git config --global user.email  // to check if everything is correct
5. git config --global user.name "Arjun"  // to configure your username
6. git config --global user.email "smthng@xyz.com"  // to configure your email

7. git add .    // to track all the files in the folder
8. git add <name of individual file>   // to track individual file

9. git rm <filename>   // remove tracked files 
10. git rm --cached <filename>   // remove files which were committed before

11. git commit <name of file> -m "Commit Message"      // to commit file
12. git commit -a -m "your commit message here"         // to add and commit files in a single command(untracked files wont be added)
13. git commit -A -m "your commit message here"         // to add and commit files in a single command(untracked file changes will also be added)

14. git commit --amend   // amend your recent commmit message
//	  To make changes to already committed files
	  Make changes in code editor, save it and do "git add ."
	  Now do "git commit --amend"   //

15.	                      **To edit a commit other than the most recent**
	1.git rebase -i HEAD~n where n is no of commits before where u wanna change
	2.editor pops up, change all "pick" keyword to "r" for files whose mesg u wanna change. Save the file.
	3.Another editor pops up, now change the needed commit message and save file.
	4.git push -f to make changes to github repo

16. git revert <SHA(7char) of commit> 
//If lines of code were added, then revert will delete it and vice-versa and new commit is created with these changes

17. git remote add origin <http link of github repo>  // link github repo
18. git remote -v                                     //verifies github repo

19. git push -u origin master  // to push the committed changes to repo in github

20. git status  // To check the status 

21. git log           // Commit history including author, date, time

    press f to move down by a full page
	press d to move down by half page
add --oneline flag to show only the SHA and commit messages of each commit
add --stat flag to show what all changes were made to which all files
add --patch flag to see exactly in which line of code the changes were made
add --graph -all to see commits in all different branches

22. git tag -a <tagNAME>  // Tag added to latest commit. Tags are used to give addtl info which are not to be added in commit message 
23. git tag -a <tagNAME> <SHA(7 char)>   //Tag will be added to the commit with the SHA given
24. git log                             // To see which tag is associated with which commit

25. .gitignore    // version control will ignore these files

26. git diff     // same as git log -p but the difference is that it will show the changes happened in a file before committing

27. git branch                  // view all branches
28. git branch -M main          // Changes the name of the current branch eg: master to main
29. git branch <branchname>     // create a new branch
30. git checkout <branchname>   // navigate to a branch
31. git branch -d <branchname>  // delete a branch 

32. git merge <branchname> // While on a branch, merging with another branch will 
                           // take the changes from that branch combine with this branch and create a new commit where the head points to.
						   // For fast forward merges, there's no need for commit mesg but for divergent merges, there must be.

	//Resolving merge conflicts//
	** Merge conflict occurs when a same line is edited and committed in both branches so git doesn't
	know which changes to keep track of.				   
    ** It will appear in "git status" during merging and the code editor will also show the differences.
	** Choose which change to keep and delete the other one, then make a new commit to resolve conflict. 

33. git reset <SHA(7char) to which u want to move back> //This will perform the foll things based on the flags provided:
	--mixed  // Default flag which moves the head pointer to where SHA commit is and move recent commit to working directory
    --soft   //Move the head pointer to where SHA commit is and move recent commit to staging index
	--hard   //Move the head pointer to where SHA commit is and erase the recent commit

34. git stash  // Stash changes so that you can switch to a different branch without committing changes
35. git stash list // List the stashed changes
36. git stash apply // Apply the changes that you had stashed previously
